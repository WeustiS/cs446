The dataset is about the brain tumor of human. Each sample is represented by a tensor of size = 4 x H x W x D, where the four 3D tensor represents the a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), c) T2-weighted (T2), and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes of tumor scan. You are expected to predict the tumor segmentation at voxel level, i.e. the output dimension for each sample would be H x W x D. \nNote, each sample does not have the fixed dimension - H, W, and D. Your are models are responsible to handle this circumstance. \nThe zip file contains the train and validation split of dataset.
